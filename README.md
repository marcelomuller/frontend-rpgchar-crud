# RPG Chars CRUD

CRUD application made with the MERN stack (Mongo Express React Node).

The "RPG characters" was just an excuse to make something fun.

You can create, edit and delete RPG characters with a name, age, race, job (class) and weapon.

The server is hosted on Heroku and the client on Netlify.
